    "PageDescription": "Truth is a discord bot that messages the national days, fun facts, and holidays and for the current day to a Discord channel. It will message the channel at 6:00 AM CST every day. There are currently 100+ Discord servers using the bot. Originally, the bot was made for an entirely different reason, so that is why the name is Truth instead of something more fitting.",
    "Description": "This bot was primarily made using JavaScript with Discord.js and Node.js. However, Python is used to scrape the information from a few different websites. The bot is hosted on an AWS EC2 Instance running linux and uses AWS DynamoDB to store the server data such as server ids, channel numbers, and the server's name. The EC2 instance runs a cron job that runs a Python script for web scrapping at 5:59. It will store the data locally (overwritting the pervious data). Then, using the Cron Node.js package, the bot will read that local data and send it to each of the servers. I had problems with Node.js not staying alive long enough, it would go down after a few hours, so I utilized a package called PM2 in linux to keep the bot alive while the instance was not connected to.",

Everyone knows about the urge to play Minecraft once a year for about 1 week. My goal was to add an extra week or two with new functionality.
